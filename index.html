        <h1>The Fountain Festival</h1>
        <p>The Fountain Festival is an annual celebration to cap off the year and welcome in the new one.</p>
        <p>So its kinda like New Years Eve right? Well yeah, but much better. NYE has lost its way, it sucks. The
            Fountain Festival is the answer.</p>
        <p>The Fountain Festival isnt about resolutions and countdowns, its about celebrating the good times from
            the past year and bringing on the new year which promises to be even better.</p>
        <p>No party poppers, no lines or overpriced and overrated nye events. Just getting together with friends,
            drinking from a fountain and having a good time.</p>

                <p>On entry to the party you should drink from the Fountain</p>
                <p>No contamination of the Fountain.</p>
                <p>Spilling your drink or similar liquid wastage is in direct opposition to the values of the
                    fountain, and is therefore considered a fountain fail.</p>
                <p>All fountain fails require the offending person to drink from the fountain immediately. If
                    its due to spilling of a drink then amount spilled should be consumed.
                </p>
                <p>Going to the bathroom is considered a non-sanctioned fountain and therefore the one true
                    fountain should be honoured immediately by consuming from it.
                </p>
                <p>One the hour each participant should draw a card from a deck of cards. Highest card get the
                    privilege of next drink from the fountain.

                <p>A fountain, obviously. Traditional fountains types are a Frog, and lady with exposed breasts or a

                <p>Drinking from the beverage fountain symbolises the flow of awesomeness that emcompasses the
                    festival. Drinking from the fountain is believed to ensure the good times will flow in the
                    coming year.</p>

            <div id="faq10" class="collapse" role="tabpanel">
                <p>Pretty much anything alcoholic beverage can be consumed from the fountain. Generally beer or
                    cocktails are traditional in western cultures. In Japan sake is often the beverage of choice, in
                    Italy its wine and there are many more variances you can try. In Mexico its often tequila - but
                    we don't recommend that, those Mexicans are crazy.</p>
                <p>No madori or similar</p>
                <p>Here is a good recipe to get your started:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>6 bottles of dry red wine</li>
                    <li>750ml pulp free orange juice</li>
                    <li>2 1.25L bottles of ginger ale</li>
                    <li>2 1.25L bottles of lemonade or lemon mineral water</li>
                    <li>500ml spiced rum</li>
                    <li>dash of cinnamon</li>
                    <li>wedges of oranges and lemons</li>

            <div id="faq11" class="collapse" role="tabpanel">
                <p>The first fountain festival miracle happened with the legendary Steve was able to pee only into
                    the urinal despite his obvious intoxication and at a distance far beyond the recommended range
                    for safe urination.</p>
                <p>With each year more and more miracles are reported during Fountain Festivals. Its tradition for
                    everyone to drink from the fountain when a miracle occurs.</p>
